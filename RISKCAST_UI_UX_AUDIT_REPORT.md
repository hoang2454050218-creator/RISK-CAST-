# RISKCAST — Enterprise UI/UX Audit Report
## Generated by Cursor Agent | Date: February 6, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

RISKCAST is a well-architected frontend prototype that successfully demonstrates a novel decision intelligence concept — the 7 Questions framework — with genuine design ambition. The token system, component architecture, and decision flow show serious craft. However, the product remains a **high-fidelity prototype masquerading as an enterprise tool**: authentication accepts any credentials, half the pages run on hardcoded mock data, 10+ user actions fire only a toast notification with no persistence, and ~1,400 lines of dead code sit undeleted. The decision system itself (Q1-Q7, keyboard shortcuts, SHA-256 audit trail) is the strongest asset and would survive investor scrutiny. Everything else — from the "Export Report (Demo mode)" buttons to the uncontrolled notification toggles in Settings — would not.

## SECTION SCORES

| # | Dimension | Score | One-Line Verdict |
|---|-----------|-------|------------------|
| D1 | First Impression & Trust | 6/10 | Strong dark-mode terminal aesthetic undermined by "Demo mode" signals everywhere |
| D2 | Information Architecture | 6/10 | Logical grouping with proper nested routes, but flat hierarchy and no role-based views |
| D3 | Data Density & Readability | 7/10 | Best-in-class token system with tabular numbers, i18n formatters, and chart theming |
| D4 | Decision Clarity | 7/10 | Executive summary + tier system + real keyboard shortcuts make Q1-Q7 genuinely useful |
| D5 | Visual System Consistency | 6/10 | Unified StatCard and CVA variants, but charts bypass the token system with hardcoded Tailwind classes |
| D6 | Interaction & Feedback | 4/10 | 10+ fake actions (toast-only), uncontrolled form elements, and "(Demo mode)" exports destroy trust |
| D7 | Enterprise Readiness | 3/10 | Any-credential auth, zero real persistence, half the pages on mock data — automatic caps apply |
| D8 | Design System Scalability | 6/10 | Clean architecture with TypeScript and CVA, but no Storybook, no barrel exports, dead code persists |

---

## OVERALL SCORE: 5.6 / 10

This score reflects a product with genuine design vision and strong component architecture (the 7Q decision system, token system, and chart theming are legitimately impressive) dragged down by the gap between what the UI promises and what it delivers. The decision flow scores 7/10 in isolation; the enterprise readiness scores 3/10. An investor sees both. The weighted average reflects the reality that a product is only as strong as its weakest trust signal.

## READINESS LEVEL

- [ ] Concept Demo
- [x] **Prototype**
- [ ] Early Production
- [ ] Production-Ready
- [ ] Enterprise-Ready
- [ ] Investor-Grade
- [ ] World-Class

RISKCAST sits at the **upper boundary of Prototype**. The decision system, component architecture, and design token system are production-quality code. But the product as a whole cannot ship: authentication is fake, data doesn't persist, and too many interactions are simulated. One sprint of real API integration and auth would push this to Early Production. Two more sprints of cleanup (dead code, fake actions, role-based views) would push to Production-Ready.

## D1: FIRST IMPRESSION & TRUST — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 6/10

The visual identity is ambitious and partially successful. The dark mode terminal aesthetic — cyan accents (`#00F5FF`), deep navy backgrounds (`#0a0f1a`), JetBrains Mono for data, Inter for prose — creates a genuinely distinctive look. The 989-line `index.css` establishes a comprehensive token system that rivals funded startups. The login page (`auth/login/page.tsx`) makes a strong first impression with its Bloomberg-terminal styling.

### Strengths

- **Token system depth** (`index.css:1-193`): 50+ color tokens, 5 semantic color categories (urgency, severity, confidence, actions, chart), full shadow scale with glow variants, timing functions, duration tokens. This is above-average token coverage.
- **Dark mode is systematic** (`index.css:200-314`): Complete variable override for dark mode with terminal-specific additions (scanlines, grid, corner brackets). Not a patchwork — every token has a dark variant.
- **Terminal effects are properly gated** (`index.css:178-183`): `--terminal-scan-line-opacity: 0` in light mode, `0.03` in dark. Effects enhance rather than distract.
- **Login page** (`auth/login/page.tsx:49-186`): Full-screen dark aesthetic with grid background, radial glow, branded icon, form validation, loading state, error display. Professional entry point.
- **Lazy loading** (`router.tsx:8-22`): All 14 pages lazy-loaded with Suspense fallback. Performance-conscious.

### Weaknesses

- **"Demo mode — any credentials will work"** (`auth/login/page.tsx:183`): Displayed 1 second after page load. An investor or enterprise evaluator sees this immediately. Instant credibility loss.
- **Login page hardcodes `bg-[#0a0a0f]`** (`auth/login/page.tsx:50`): Bypasses the token system (`var(--color-background)`) for the most important first-impression page.
- **"Secure connection · Enterprise grade" text** (`auth/login/page.tsx:171`): Displayed below a form that accepts literally any input. This is worse than no claim at all.
- **Light mode is generic** (`index.css:50-88`): White backgrounds, blue accents, standard shadows. Competent but indistinguishable from any Tailwind template. The terminal identity vanishes.
- **User avatar gradient is hardcoded** (`TopBar.tsx`): `from-blue-500 to-purple-600` in the avatar — not using tokens.

### Trust Impact Assessment

The dark mode terminal aesthetic works for the target persona (logistics risk analyst) and creates legitimate differentiation. The login page almost achieves "serious tool" credibility but self-sabotages with the demo hint. Light mode would not survive competitive comparison — it looks like any SaaS dashboard.

## D2: INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 6/10

The navigation structure is logical and the route hierarchy correctly nests detail pages under list pages. Three sidebar groups (Operations, Intelligence, System) map reasonably to user mental models. Dynamic badge counts from API hooks prevent the "hardcoded demo" feel. However, 9 sidebar items is heavy for an MVP that claims focus, and there is no role-based navigation.

### Strengths

- **Proper route nesting** (`router.tsx:66-139`): Decisions, signals, customers, and human-review all have `index` + `:id` child routes under `AppLayout`. Correct React Router patterns.
- **ProtectedRoute wrapper** (`router.tsx:60-65`): All app routes wrapped in `ProtectedRoute`, login is a separate public route. Clean separation.
- **Sidebar grouping** (`Sidebar.tsx`): Operations (Dashboard, Signals, Decisions, Human Review, Customers), Intelligence (Analytics, Oracle Reality), System (Audit Trail, Settings). Groups are semantic, not arbitrary.
- **Dynamic badge counts** (`Sidebar.tsx`): Badge counts use `useDecisionsList()` and `useEscalationsList()` hooks — live data, not hardcoded numbers.
- **Command palette** (`command-palette.tsx:1-449`): Cmd+K navigation with fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, section grouping. Genuinely functional.
- **404 page exists** (`not-found/page.tsx:1-67`): Custom-designed with terminal aesthetic, back button, and home link.

### Weaknesses

- **9 sidebar items for MVP**: Dashboard, Signals, Decisions, Human Review, Customers, Analytics, Oracle Reality, Audit Trail, Settings. For a product that claims "Red Sea chokepoint only" as MVP scope, Analytics, Oracle Reality, and Audit Trail could be secondary/hidden. Decision paralysis risk.
- **No role-based navigation**: Analyst, Manager, Executive, Viewer all see identical sidebar. No role guards beyond the `ProtectedRoute` authentication check. An analyst shouldn't see Settings; an executive shouldn't need to navigate 9 items.
- **No breadcrumbs on detail pages**: `DecisionHeader.tsx` shows decision metadata but no breadcrumb trail (Decisions > DEC-2024-001). User loses positional awareness.
- **Breadcrumbs component exists** (`components/ui/breadcrumbs.tsx`) but its usage on detail pages is not verified as consistent.
- **No clear "happy path"**: The flow Signal → Decision → Action is the core workflow, but there's no visual pipeline or guided flow. Users must know to navigate between pages manually.
- **Command palette suggestions are hardcoded**: (`command-palette.tsx`) Empty state suggests `['dashboard', 'decisions', 'signals', 'settings']` — static, not contextual.

---

## D3: DATA DENSITY & READABILITY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 7/10

This is the strongest technical foundation in the codebase. The typography system, number formatting, tabular figures, and chart theming demonstrate genuine understanding of financial/analytical data presentation. The formatters library supports internationalization out of the box.

### Strengths

- **Dual font system** (`index.css:90-91`): Inter for prose, JetBrains Mono for data. Correct separation for analytical interfaces.
- **Tabular numbers defined** (`index.css:529-532`): `.font-tabular { font-feature-settings: 'tnum' 1; font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; }` — critical for number column alignment.
- **`.data-value` class** (`index.css:618-623`): Combines mono font + tabular nums + tight letter-spacing. Bloomberg-appropriate.
- **Full i18n formatters** (`formatters.ts:1-305`): `formatCurrency`, `formatCurrencyRange`, `formatPercentage`, `formatDuration`, `formatDelayRange`, `formatCountdown`, `formatShipmentCount`, `formatTEU`. All use `Intl.NumberFormat` with locale support. Vietnamese locale included.
- **AnimatedNumber with aria-live** (`animated-number.tsx:78-79`): `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"` — screen readers announce value changes.
- **Chart theme system** (`chart-theme.ts:1-512`): `useChartColors()` hook returns theme-aware colors. Light and dark palettes with full color objects (primary, secondary, glow, dim, gradient).
- **All chart components have axis labels and units**: CostEscalationChart has USD-formatted Y-axis, ExposureChart has currency X-axis, TimelineVisualization has date-formatted milestones.

### Weaknesses

- **Charts bypass token system**: ConfidenceGauge uses `text-emerald-600`, `text-amber-600`, `text-red-600` (hardcoded Tailwind) instead of `text-confidence-high`, etc. 6 chart components have this pattern.
- **SignalCard and EvidenceList don't use `useChartColors()`**: (`SignalCard.tsx`, `EvidenceList.tsx`) — these components hardcode Tailwind color classes for source badges and confidence indicators, bypassing the theme system entirely.
- **Color as sole differentiator**: All charts and badges rely on color alone for severity/confidence/urgency. No patterns, shapes, or icons as secondary differentiators for colorblind users. WCAG 1.4.1 violation.
- **No verified usage of font-tabular on ALL numeric contexts**: The class exists in CSS but whether every numeric display in every page actually applies it is not guaranteed.

---

## D4: DECISION CLARITY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 7/10

The decision system is the product's strongest feature and genuinely differentiated. The 7 Questions framework, executive summary, tier-based visual hierarchy, real keyboard shortcuts, and SHA-256 audit trail create a decision experience that surpasses most funded competitors. This section alone would justify investor interest.

### Strengths

- **Executive Summary exists** (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx:157`): `<ExecutiveSummary>` component rendered before the 7 questions. User gets a TL;DR without scrolling.
- **Tier system** (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx`): Q1 and Q5 are PRIMARY (border-l-4 accent, glow, larger pills). Q3/Q7 are SECONDARY. Q2/Q4/Q6 are SUPPORTING (opacity-90, collapsible). Clear visual hierarchy.
- **Q5 recommended action highlighting** (`Q5WhatToDo.tsx:39,52-56`): `isRecommended` prop adds `ring-2 ring-accent/20`, "Recommended" badge with Sparkles icon. Alternatives shown below with cost comparison table.
- **Real keyboard shortcuts** (`ActionButtons.tsx:73-88`): Enter → Acknowledge, O → Override, E → Escalate. Wired to actual event listeners with guards for input fields and modals.
- **ConfirmationDialog for high-stakes actions** (`confirmation-dialog.tsx:1-222`): Focus trapping, Escape to close, loading state, variant styles (default/warning/danger). Used in `decisions/[id]/page.tsx`, `decisions/page.tsx`, `human-review/[id]/page.tsx`, `signals/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **Real SHA-256 audit trail** (`AuditTrailFooter.tsx:27-32`): Hash computed via Web Crypto API from decision fields (id, version, created_at, q1, q3_exposure, q5_action, q5_cost, q7_inaction). Verification recomputes and compares. Not decorative.
- **Scenario visualization** (`ScenarioVisualization.tsx`): Best/base/worst cases with probability bars and expected value calculator.
- **Cost escalation chart** (`CostEscalationChart.tsx`): Line chart showing inaction cost over time with "point of no return" reference line.

### Weaknesses

- **Q5 is 664 lines of component code**: Even with good visual hierarchy, the rendered output for "What to do?" includes recommended action, alternatives, cost comparison table, and advantages/disadvantages. Under time pressure, this is too much.
- **No single-line verdict above executive summary**: "REROUTE via Cape, $8,500, deadline 6PM UTC" should be visible in 1 line before any scrolling. Currently requires reading the executive summary paragraph.
- **Confidence calibration context is thin**: (`Q6Confidence.tsx`) Shows the score and factors but doesn't answer "is 78% good for this type of decision?" No historical comparison or calibration benchmarks.
- **Q5 advantages/disadvantages are hardcoded templates** (`Q5WhatToDo.tsx:515-541`): Static lists rather than decision-specific data from the backend.
- **All 7 questions rendered on one page**: No progressive disclosure option. On mobile, this is a very long scroll.

---

## D5: VISUAL SYSTEM CONSISTENCY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 6/10

The design system has genuine architectural quality — CVA variants, unified StatCard, shared FilterDropdown, and a comprehensive token system. However, the gap between the system's design (excellent) and its enforcement (inconsistent) is the core issue. Components that should use the chart-theme.ts tokens instead use hardcoded Tailwind classes.

### Strengths

- **StatCard is unified** (`components/domain/common/StatCard.tsx:1-327`): Single shared component with 2 variants (default, overlay), 7 accent colors, trend badges, animated numbers. Comment on line 4 explicitly notes it "replaces 5 local reimplementations." Pages import and use it correctly.
- **FilterDropdown is shared** (`components/ui/filter-dropdown.tsx`): Used in `decisions/page.tsx`, `signals/page.tsx`, `human-review/page.tsx`.
- **CVA button variants** (`button.tsx`): 16 variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link, premium, premium-outline, reroute, delay, insure, monitor, urgent, immediate, success, error) + 7 sizes. Comprehensive coverage.
- **CVA badge variants** (`badge.tsx`): 29 variants covering urgency, severity, confidence, actions, and status states.
- **Token system in index.css**: 50+ color tokens with systematic dark mode overrides. Spacing scale (0 to 24), border-radius scale (none to full), shadow scale (xs to 2xl + glow variants).

### Weaknesses

- **Charts bypass token system**: ConfidenceGauge, CausalChainDiagram, CostEscalationChart, ExposureChart, ScenarioVisualization, and TimelineVisualization all use hardcoded Tailwind classes (`text-emerald-600`, `text-amber-600`, `text-red-600`) instead of semantic tokens (`text-confidence-high`, `text-severity-high`).
- **SignalCard doesn't use chart-theme.ts** (`SignalCard.tsx:46-72`): Event type colors, status gradients, and source badge colors are all hardcoded Tailwind classes.
- **EvidenceList doesn't use chart-theme.ts** (`EvidenceList.tsx:26-32`): Source type colors hardcoded as `bg-purple-100 text-purple-600`, etc.
- **29 badge variants borders on bloat**: `pending`, `acknowledged`, `overridden`, `expired`, `escalated` variants in badge.tsx add complexity. Consider whether status badges need CVA variants or could use a simpler config pattern.
- **Login page hardcodes bg-[#0a0a0f]** (`auth/login/page.tsx:50`): The most visible page bypasses the token system.
- **TopBar avatar uses hardcoded gradient** (`TopBar.tsx`): `from-blue-500 to-purple-600`.

## D6: INTERACTION & FEEDBACK — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 4/10

This is the dimension where the gap between UI promise and actual functionality is most damaging. The Button component has full state coverage, the toast system is well-built, and ConfirmationDialog is production-quality. But across 14 pages, 10+ user actions are purely cosmetic — firing a toast and doing nothing real. Several pages explicitly say "(Demo mode)" in their toast messages. This is the primary trust-destruction vector.

### Strengths

- **Button state coverage** (`button.tsx`): `isLoading` with Loader2 spinner, `loadingText`, `disabled`, hover/tap animations via Framer Motion, focus-visible ring, ripple effect option.
- **Toast system** (`toast.tsx:1-400`): Zustand store, 5 types (success/error/warning/info/loading), `toast.promise()` wrapper, auto-dismiss with progress bar, multiple positions, proper ARIA roles.
- **ConfirmationDialog** (`confirmation-dialog.tsx:1-222`): Focus trapping, Escape to close, body scroll lock, loading state, 3 visual variants (default/warning/danger), `role="alertdialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`.
- **Keyboard shortcuts are real** (`ActionButtons.tsx:73-88`): Enter/O/E wired to actual event handlers with proper guards.

### Weaknesses — Fake Action Registry (see dedicated section below)

- **Dashboard**: `handleSystemStatus` → toast only (`dashboard/page.tsx:143-144`)
- **Customers list**: `handleAddCustomer` → toast only (`customers/page.tsx:66-67`)
- **Customer detail**: `handleEditCustomer` → toast only (`customers/[id]/page.tsx:228-229`)
- **Analytics**: `handleExportReport` → toast "(Demo mode)" (`analytics/page.tsx`)
- **Analytics**: `handleDateRangeChange` → cycles state + toast, no data change (`analytics/page.tsx`)
- **Audit**: `handleExport` → toast "(Demo mode)" (`audit/page.tsx`)
- **Audit**: `handleDateRangeChange` → cycles state + toast, no data change (`audit/page.tsx`)
- **Reality**: `handleRefresh` → `setTimeout` fake delay, no real fetch (`reality/page.tsx`)
- **Signals detail**: `handleGenerateDecision` → toast + navigation to hardcoded `'dec_001'` (`signals/[id]/page.tsx:94-96`)
- **Human Review detail**: `handleAddComment` → toast only, no persistence (`human-review/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Human Review detail**: `handleAssignToMe` → toast only (`human-review/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Settings**: "Invite Member" button → no handler at all (`settings/page.tsx`)
- **Settings**: Notification toggles → uncontrolled checkboxes (`settings/page.tsx`)

### Trust Impact

Each fake action is a micro-betrayal. An enterprise evaluator who clicks "Export Report" and sees "(Demo mode)" immediately downgrades credibility of every other button. The cumulative effect of 10+ such moments transforms "promising product" into "demo with good CSS."

---

## D7: ENTERPRISE READINESS — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 3/10

Automatic cap applied: Authentication accepts any credentials (cap at 4/10). Multiple pages run on hardcoded mock data only (cap at 3/10 for those pages). The architectural foundations (React Query, API client, mock fallback pattern) demonstrate the developer knows how to build real integrations — they just haven't been completed yet.

### Strengths

- **Auth shell exists** (`lib/auth.tsx:1-102`): `AuthProvider`, `useAuth`, `ProtectedRoute` with login redirect. Proper context pattern. The architecture is correct even if the implementation is fake.
- **API client** (`lib/api.ts`): Real `fetch`-based client with error handling and `withMockFallback` utility. Functions for decisions, signals, customers, escalations, dashboard, analytics, audit, reality engine, and health check.
- **React Query integration**: `useDecisionsList()`, `useDecision(id)`, `useSignalsList()`, `useSignal(id)`, `useEscalationsList()` hooks exist and are used by their respective pages. Mutations for acknowledge, override, escalate.
- **ErrorBoundary** (`error-boundary.tsx:1-164`): Class component with `getDerivedStateFromError`, development error details, retry mechanism.
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens on decisions, signals, human-review list, and decision detail pages.
- **Empty states**: Present on decisions, signals, customers, human-review list pages.
- **Error states**: Present on decisions, signals, human-review list, decision detail, signal detail pages.
- **Pagination**: Implemented on decisions and signals list pages.
- **20 test files**: Covering hooks (useDecisions, useSignals, useEscalations, usePagination, useAsyncAction, useSwipeGesture), components (Button, Badge, Toast, ConfirmationDialog, FilterDropdown, Breadcrumbs, StatCard, SignalCard, ConfidenceGauge, DecisionCard, ExecutiveSummary), context (user-context), and lib (utils, formatters).
- **404 page** (`not-found/page.tsx:1-67`): Custom-designed, not a catch-all div.

### Weaknesses

- **Auth accepts ANY credentials** (`lib/auth.tsx:55-56`): `const token = riskcast_demo_${btoa(email)}_${Date.now()}`. No validation whatsoever.
- **No role-based authorization**: No role guards, no permission checks, no role-based view differentiation.
- **Pages on pure mock data** (no API hook, no real data):
  - `dashboard/page.tsx`: Hardcoded `stats`, `urgentDecisions`, `chokepointHealth`, `recentActivity`
  - `customers/page.tsx`: `mockCustomers` array
  - `customers/[id]/page.tsx`: `mockCustomerDetails` + `defaultCustomer`
  - `analytics/page.tsx`: Hardcoded `performanceMetrics`, `decisionsByWeek`, `calibrationData`, etc.
  - `audit/page.tsx`: `mockAuditEvents` array
  - `reality/page.tsx`: `mockChokepoints`, `mockRates`, `mockVesselAlerts`
  - `human-review/[id]/page.tsx`: `mockEscalations` + `defaultEscalation`
- **Dead code** (~1,410 lines): `App.tsx` (270 lines), `stores/app.ts` (250 lines), `language-switcher.tsx` (94 lines), `progress-ring.tsx` (410 lines), `BatchOperations.tsx` (386 lines). All confirmed unused — no imports anywhere.
- **Hardcoded user references**: `'current_user'` in decisions pages, hardcoded team members in settings, hardcoded names in audit events.
- **No real data persistence**: Settings saves to localStorage only. Decision actions go through mutations but backend doesn't exist.
- **`any` types**: Found in `analytics/page.tsx` (4 instances in Recharts tooltip props).
- **console.log in dead code**: `BatchOperations.tsx` lines 125, 135, 145.
- **TODO comment**: `error-boundary.tsx:55` — "TODO: Send to error reporting service (e.g., Sentry)"

### Accessibility (WCAG AA) Summary

- **Positive**: `aria-live` on animated numbers, `aria-label` on navigation and charts, `role="alertdialog"` on confirmation dialog, `role="timer"` on countdown, skip link in AppLayout, `prefers-reduced-motion` support in CSS, 44px minimum touch targets in MobileNav.
- **Negative**: Color-only differentiation throughout charts and badges (WCAG 1.4.1), SwipeableCard has no keyboard alternative (touch-only), CommandPalette lacks focus trap, several chart SVGs lack descriptive text.

### Responsiveness Assessment

- **Breakpoints used**: `md:` (768px+) as primary desktop/mobile split, `sm:` for small adjustments.
- **Mobile navigation**: Bottom nav bar (`MobileNav.tsx`) with overflow sheet, 44px touch targets.
- **iPad Pro risk**: The sidebar collapse at `md:` breakpoint means tablet users get the mobile experience. A logistics executive on an iPad Pro in portrait (810px) would see the full desktop layout; in landscape (1080px) they'd see desktop — acceptable. But the `md:ml-64` / `md:ml-16` sidebar widths are hardcoded in pixels, not responsive to available space.
- **7 Questions on mobile**: All questions render vertically with supporting questions collapsible — reasonable but very long scroll.

### Error Boundary / White Screen of Death Assessment

If the API returns 500: Pages using React Query (`decisions/page.tsx`, `signals/page.tsx`, `human-review/page.tsx`) will show their local error states with retry buttons. Pages on mock data have no API dependency, so they won't break. The global `ErrorBoundary` in `AppLayout.tsx` catches React rendering errors. **Verdict**: The app will NOT white-screen on API failure for properly instrumented pages, but pages without error states (dashboard, customers, analytics, audit, reality) would continue showing stale/mock data silently — no error signal at all.

---

## D8: DESIGN SYSTEM SCALABILITY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 6/10

The architectural patterns are correct and would scale with discipline. TypeScript typing is strong, file organization is clear, and the CVA + Tailwind pattern is industry-standard. The main risks are enforcement gaps (charts bypassing tokens), dead code accumulation, and absence of component documentation.

### Strengths

- **Strong TypeScript typing**: Minimal `any` usage (only in analytics Recharts tooltips). All component props have proper interfaces. Enums used for urgency, severity, confidence, action types.
- **Type completeness for 7 Questions** (`types/decision.ts:1-278`): Q1Data through Q7Data, ConfidenceInterval, ConfidenceCalibration, ShipmentExposure all typed. 
- **Clean file organization**: `components/ui/` (primitives), `components/domain/` (business logic), `components/charts/` (visualizations), `app/` (pages), `lib/` (utilities), `types/` (type definitions), `hooks/` (custom hooks).
- **CVA pattern** (`button.tsx`, `badge.tsx`): Class Variance Authority for variant management. Industry-standard approach that scales.
- **Animation system** (`animations.ts:1-688`): 30+ named variants, spring configurations, stagger containers, utility functions. Comprehensive and reusable.
- **Chart theme hook** (`chart-theme.ts:205-225`): `useChartColors()` returns theme-reactive colors. Correct pattern even if not universally applied.
- **20 test files**: Unit tests for hooks, components, and utilities.
- **Prettier + ESLint configured** (`package.json:14-15`): `format` and `format:check` scripts, `eslint-config-prettier` dependency.
- **Vitest configured** (`vite.config.ts:15-20`): Test environment setup with jsdom.

### Weaknesses

- **No Storybook**: Zero component documentation system. A new developer must read source code to understand variants and props.
- **No barrel exports**: Components imported directly by file path (`@/components/ui/button`), not from `@/components/ui`. No `index.ts` barrel files found consistently.
- **Dead code accumulation** (5 files, ~1,410 lines): Signals poor maintenance hygiene. In a team setting, this would grow rapidly.
- **Chart components don't enforce theme system**: 6 of 8 chart/visualization components use hardcoded Tailwind classes instead of `useChartColors()` for status colors.
- **No prop documentation**: JSDoc comments on StatCard props (good) but not consistently applied across all components.
- **`lib/animations.ts` usage verification**: The 688-line animation system exports 30+ variants, but their actual usage across components varies. Some (like `gaugeProgress`, `chartBar`) may be partially unused.

## COMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING

### vs Bloomberg Terminal

- **Data density**: RISKCAST achieves ~40% of Bloomberg's information density. Bloomberg packs 20+ data points per screen area; RISKCAST uses generous spacing and card layouts. The `data-value` CSS class and tabular numbers show the right intention, but actual pages don't maximize density.
- **Keyboard-first interaction**: RISKCAST has keyboard shortcuts only in ActionButtons (Enter/O/E) and CommandPalette (Cmd+K). Bloomberg is entirely keyboard-navigable. RISKCAST is mouse-first with keyboard accents.
- **Information hierarchy**: Bloomberg uses spatial position + color + size for hierarchy. RISKCAST uses the tier system in SevenQuestionsView effectively but lacks Bloomberg's density-based scanning patterns on other pages.
- **Trust/authority**: Bloomberg's terminal IS the authority through decades of institutional use. RISKCAST attempts visual mimicry (scanlines, glow, mono font) but the "Demo mode" hints and fake actions immediately break the illusion.
- **Where RISKCAST is weaker**: Keyboard navigation depth, data density per pixel, real-time data integration.
- **Where RISKCAST is competitive**: Decision-specific UX (7Q framework), visual polish on dark mode, animated transitions.
- **Where RISKCAST is clearly behind**: Trust signals, data volume handling, institutional credibility.

### vs Palantir Foundry

- **Analytical depth**: Palantir handles arbitrary data ontologies and multi-step analytical workflows. RISKCAST handles one workflow (signal → decision → action) with one data model. Not comparable in scope.
- **Workflow complexity**: Palantir supports branching analysis, collaborative annotations, and versioned datasets. RISKCAST supports a linear 7Q flow. Much simpler.
- **Visual gravitas**: Palantir's dark interfaces communicate "defense-grade intelligence tool." RISKCAST achieves "premium dashboard tool" — a tier below.
- **AI integration UX**: RISKCAST's ReasoningTraceModal and confidence breakdown are more transparent about AI reasoning than Palantir's typical opacity. This is a genuine advantage.
- **Where RISKCAST is weaker**: Data model flexibility, collaboration features, workflow complexity.
- **Where RISKCAST is competitive**: AI reasoning transparency, decision-specific UX clarity.
- **Where RISKCAST is clearly behind**: Scale, institutional trust, real-world deployment.

### vs Stripe Dashboard

- **Design system discipline**: Stripe's component system is legendary — every component follows strict patterns, tokens are universally enforced, and documentation is exhaustive. RISKCAST's token system is comprehensive but enforcement is inconsistent (charts bypassing tokens).
- **Component consistency**: Stripe would never have a component bypass the design system. RISKCAST has 6 chart components using hardcoded colors.
- **Error handling**: Stripe handles every error state, loading state, and edge case. RISKCAST handles them on some pages (decisions, signals) but not others (dashboard, customers, analytics).
- **Developer experience**: Stripe has Storybook, comprehensive docs, and clear conventions. RISKCAST has neither.
- **Where RISKCAST is weaker**: System enforcement, error state coverage, documentation.
- **Where RISKCAST is competitive**: Token system design quality, animation system richness.
- **Where RISKCAST is clearly behind**: Consistency enforcement, component documentation, testing coverage.

### vs Notion

- **Information structure clarity**: Notion's flat-but-nestable structure is universally intuitive. RISKCAST's 9-item sidebar is functional but creates more cognitive load than necessary.
- **Navigation simplicity**: Notion's sidebar collapses and expands contextually. RISKCAST's sidebar is static.
- **Empty state handling**: Notion's empty states are famously welcoming and guide next actions. RISKCAST has empty states on list pages but they're utilitarian, not guiding.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Notion reveals complexity gradually. RISKCAST's 7 Questions have a tier system but no progressive disclosure toggle (all questions visible at once).
- **Where RISKCAST is weaker**: Progressive disclosure, empty state quality, navigation simplicity.
- **Where RISKCAST is competitive**: Domain-specific UX for structured decisions.
- **Where RISKCAST is clearly behind**: Simplicity, onboarding, empty state delight.

### vs Flexport / Everstream / project44

- **Domain-specific relevance**: RISKCAST speaks the right language: chokepoints, TEU, reroute costs, container counts, shipping delays. The domain vocabulary is correct.
- **Logistics data presentation**: Flexport shows actual tracking data, carrier information, and customs status. RISKCAST shows risk analysis and decision recommendations — complementary, not competing.
- **Supply chain terminology**: Properly used throughout. Shipment IDs, container counts, chokepoint names, delay ranges in days.
- **Operational workflow**: Flexport/project44 support operational execution (booking, tracking, documentation). RISKCAST supports decision-making about risk. Different layer of the workflow.
- **Where RISKCAST is weaker**: Real operational data integration, carrier/customs integration.
- **Where RISKCAST is competitive**: Risk-specific decision UX, 7Q framework, AI reasoning transparency.
- **Where RISKCAST is clearly behind**: Real data, operational depth, market adoption.

## TOP 5 CRITICAL WEAKNESSES

### 1. Authentication is Fake

- **What**: `login()` accepts any email/password, generates a demo token, stores in localStorage.
- **Where**: `lib/auth.tsx:51-58`, `auth/login/page.tsx:183`
- **Trust Impact**: The login page says "Secure connection · Enterprise grade" while accepting any input. An evaluator who opens devtools sees `riskcast_demo_` tokens.
- **Decision Risk**: No user identity means no audit trail attribution. `'current_user'` is hardcoded as the actor for all decision actions.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk**: Zero authentication is a non-starter for any enterprise procurement process. RBAC, SSO, and MFA are table stakes.
- **Investor Perception**: "They haven't validated any user — how do they know anyone wants this?"

### 2. Half the Pages Run on Mock Data

- **What**: 7 of 14 pages use hardcoded mock data with no API integration.
- **Where**: `dashboard/page.tsx` (lines 35-108), `customers/page.tsx` (lines 12-60), `customers/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 66-184), `analytics/page.tsx` (hardcoded metrics), `audit/page.tsx` (mockAuditEvents), `reality/page.tsx` (mock arrays), `human-review/[id]/page.tsx` (mockEscalations).
- **Trust Impact**: The dashboard — the first page every user sees — displays completely static numbers that never change.
- **Decision Risk**: Mock data creates a false sense of system capability. Investors may believe the system processes real signals when it doesn't.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk**: Enterprise buyers will test with their data. Pages that only show mock data will immediately reveal the product's incompleteness.
- **Investor Perception**: "The demo looked great, but they're showing me screenshots, not a product."

### 3. 10+ User Actions Are Purely Cosmetic

- **What**: Actions that show a toast notification with no real side effect.
- **Where**: See Fake Action Registry below.
- **Trust Impact**: Each "Export Report (Demo mode)" toast is a confession. Users who discover fake actions stop trusting real actions.
- **Decision Risk**: If a user believes they've "Assigned" an escalation to themselves but it didn't persist, the escalation falls through the cracks.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk**: Procurement teams test every button. One fake action found = all actions suspect.
- **Investor Perception**: "How much of this product actually works versus just looks like it works?"

### 4. No Role-Based Access Control

- **What**: All users see identical interface regardless of role.
- **Where**: `router.tsx` (no role guards), `Sidebar.tsx` (no conditional items), all pages (no permission checks).
- **Trust Impact**: An analyst and a VP see the same 9-item sidebar. Neither gets a tailored experience.
- **Decision Risk**: Analysts may take actions (Override, Escalate) that should require manager approval. No workflow enforcement.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk**: Enterprise procurement requires role-based access. IT security teams will reject a product with no authorization layer.
- **Investor Perception**: "Single-user tool trying to be enterprise. They haven't thought about teams."

### 5. ~1,410 Lines of Dead Code

- **What**: 5 files confirmed unused, never imported anywhere.
- **Where**: `App.tsx` (270 lines), `stores/app.ts` (250 lines), `language-switcher.tsx` (94 lines), `progress-ring.tsx` (410 lines), `BatchOperations.tsx` (386 lines).
- **Trust Impact**: Dead code signals abandoned features and poor maintenance hygiene.
- **Decision Risk**: None directly, but contributes to bundle size and codebase confusion.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk**: Security auditors flag dead code as potential attack surface.
- **Investor Perception**: "Code discipline matters. If they ship dead code, what else are they shipping?"

## TOP 5 HIGHEST-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Real Authentication + Role-Based Views

- **What to do**: Replace localStorage auth with JWT/OAuth2. Add role guards to router. Differentiate sidebar for Analyst (5 items) vs Executive (3 items) vs Admin (all).
- **Why it matters**: Removes automatic cap on D7 score. Enables real user attribution in audit trail. Unlocks enterprise procurement conversations.
- **Effort estimate**: M (1-2 weeks)
- **Files affected**: `lib/auth.tsx`, `router.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, `MobileNav.tsx`, all page files for permission checks.
- **Expected score impact**: D7: 3→5 (+2), D2: 6→7 (+1)

### 2. Wire API Integration for Remaining Pages

- **What to do**: Replace mock data in dashboard, customers, analytics, audit, reality, and human-review detail with React Query hooks calling the existing API client functions (which already exist in `lib/api.ts`).
- **Why it matters**: Removes "half the pages are fake" weakness. Dashboard becomes dynamic. API client code already written but unused by most pages.
- **Effort estimate**: M (1-2 weeks — API functions exist, need hooks + page integration)
- **Files affected**: `dashboard/page.tsx`, `customers/page.tsx`, `customers/[id]/page.tsx`, `analytics/page.tsx`, `audit/page.tsx`, `reality/page.tsx`, `human-review/[id]/page.tsx`. New hooks for each domain.
- **Expected score impact**: D7: 3→5 (+2), D6: 4→5 (+1)

### 3. Replace Fake Actions with Real Mutations or Remove Them

- **What to do**: For each fake action: either wire it to a real API mutation, or remove the button entirely. An absent button is better than a lying button. At minimum: remove "(Demo mode)" toasts, disable buttons that aren't functional with a "Coming soon" tooltip.
- **Why it matters**: Eliminates the primary trust-destruction vector. Every real action increases credibility of remaining actions.
- **Effort estimate**: S-M (3-5 days for removing/disabling, 1-2 weeks for wiring real mutations)
- **Files affected**: All page files containing toast-only handlers.
- **Expected score impact**: D6: 4→6 (+2), D7: minor +1 on trust

### 4. Delete Dead Code and Enforce Chart Theme System

- **What to do**: Delete `App.tsx`, `stores/app.ts`, `language-switcher.tsx`, `progress-ring.tsx`, `BatchOperations.tsx`. Refactor chart components to use `useChartColors()` and semantic token classes instead of hardcoded Tailwind.
- **Why it matters**: Dead code deletion is zero-risk, instant cleanup. Chart token enforcement creates visual consistency and theme-correctness.
- **Effort estimate**: S (2-3 days)
- **Files affected**: 5 dead files (delete), 6 chart files + `SignalCard.tsx` + `EvidenceList.tsx` (refactor colors).
- **Expected score impact**: D5: 6→7 (+1), D7: +0.5 (reduced technical debt), D8: 6→7 (+1)

### 5. Add Storybook for Component Documentation

- **What to do**: Set up Storybook with stories for all `components/ui/` primitives and key `components/domain/` components. Use autodocs where possible.
- **Why it matters**: Unlocks team scalability. New developers can understand the design system in hours instead of days. Investors see "team-ready infrastructure."
- **Effort estimate**: M (1 week for initial setup + core stories)
- **Files affected**: New `*.stories.tsx` files alongside existing components. New `.storybook/` configuration.
- **Expected score impact**: D8: 6→8 (+2)

## DEAD CODE & TECHNICAL DEBT INVENTORY

| File | Lines | Status | Recommendation |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 270 | DEAD — not imported by `main.tsx` or any route | Delete |
| `src/stores/app.ts` | 250 | DEAD — Zustand stores not imported anywhere | Delete |
| `src/components/ui/language-switcher.tsx` | 94 | DEAD — not imported anywhere | Delete |
| `src/components/ui/progress-ring.tsx` | 410 | DEAD — 6 exported components, zero imports | Delete |
| `src/components/domain/decisions/BatchOperations.tsx` | 386 | DEAD — not imported, contains console.log | Delete |
| **Total dead code** | **1,410** | | **Delete all** |

### Unused Dependencies

| Package | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| `zustand` (v5.0.11) | **Verify** — `stores/app.ts` is dead but toast.tsx uses Zustand. If toast store is the only usage, it's justified. If Zustand stores were intended for more, evaluate if React Query + context covers all needs. |

## COMPONENT DUPLICATION REGISTRY

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| StatCard | **UNIFIED** — single shared component at `components/domain/common/StatCard.tsx` | Used by dashboard, customers, signals/[id], human-review, audit, reality, analytics. Comment notes it "replaces 5 local reimplementations." |
| FilterDropdown | **SHARED** — `components/ui/filter-dropdown.tsx` | Used by decisions, signals, human-review pages. |
| TerminalCard | **LOCAL** in `analytics/page.tsx` | Chart wrapper card, not same as StatCard. Consider extracting if pattern repeats. |
| No other significant duplications found | | Previous reimplementation issues appear resolved. |

## DESIGN DEBT SUMMARY

The fundamental structural UX problem is the **trust gap between interface fidelity and system capability**. RISKCAST has invested heavily in visual polish — the dark mode terminal aesthetic, animated numbers, scanline effects, glow shadows — but has not invested commensurately in functional depth. The result is a product that *looks* like a Bloomberg Terminal but *behaves* like a clickable prototype. This mismatch is more damaging than a less polished but more functional product would be, because high visual fidelity sets high expectations. When a user clicks "Export Report" on a dashboard that looks this good, they expect a real PDF — not a "(Demo mode)" toast.

The path forward is not more visual polish. It is ruthlessly closing the gap between what the UI promises and what it delivers: real auth, real data, real mutations, real exports. Every hour spent on visual effects while actions are fake increases the trust debt.

## INVESTOR IMPRESSION

**Paragraph 1 — First 5 minutes:** The login screen is striking. Dark, terminal-like, professional. I enter credentials and land on a dashboard that looks expensive — animated numbers, glow effects, a well-organized sidebar with three groups. I navigate to a decision detail page and the 7 Questions framework genuinely impresses me. Executive summary at the top, cost breakdowns, scenario visualizations, a confidence gauge that explains its reasoning. The keyboard shortcuts (Enter to accept, O to override) signal thoughtful workflow design. I'm thinking: "This person understands the problem space and has real product taste. The decision UX is differentiated." I note the 20 test files, the TypeScript strictness, the clean component architecture. For a solo build, the technical craft is notable.

**Paragraph 2 — Minutes 5-15:** Then I start clicking. "Export Report" gives me "(Demo mode)." The customer page shows 4 hardcoded customers that never change. The analytics page has impressive charts showing data that isn't real. I click "Add Customer" and get a toast. I open Settings and find notification toggles that don't save. I check the login and realize any password works. My assessment shifts: the decision system is real, everything else is a shell. My question becomes: "Is the 7Q framework valuable enough to fund the 3-6 months of engineering needed to make everything else real?" The answer depends entirely on customer validation data — which this product, running on mock data, cannot yet generate. I'd want to see 5 real logistics companies using the decision flow with real data before writing a check. The UI won't be the blocker; the data will.

## CORE PRODUCT TRUTH TEST

**1. If the AI engine was removed, would the UI still feel valuable?**
No. The UI is a delivery mechanism for AI-generated decisions. Without AI output, the 7 Questions framework has no content to display. The UI's value is entirely dependent on the quality of what fills it.

**2. Is the 7-question system truly superior to a traditional risk report?**
In concept, yes. The forced structure (What → When → How Bad → Why → What To Do → Confidence → If Nothing) is more actionable than a freeform report. The tier system (PRIMARY/SUPPORTING) adds useful visual hierarchy. But the current implementation renders all 7 on one long page. Under crisis pressure, an executive may prefer a single-screen summary over scrolling through 7 sections.

**3. Would a real logistics executive rely on this during a crisis?**
Not yet. The mock data and fake actions mean there's nothing to rely on. The UX patterns are correct, but the product needs real-time data, real actions with real consequences, and several months of accuracy track record before a risk professional would trust it during a live crisis.

**4. Is this product solving a painful, frequent, expensive problem?**
Yes. Logistics risk assessment is manual, slow, and costly. The Red Sea disruptions of 2024-2025 proved the market exists. The 7Q framework addresses a real gap between "here's a risk alert" (commodity) and "here's what to do about your specific shipment" (valuable).

**5. What is the biggest illusion in this product?**
That it is a working system. The visual fidelity is so high that it creates the impression of a functioning product, but the majority of user actions have no real effect, half the pages show static data, and authentication is a facade. The gap between appearance and reality is the product's most significant liability — and its most urgent engineering priority.
