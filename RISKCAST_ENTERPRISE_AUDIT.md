# RISKCAST — Enterprise UI/UX Audit Report
## Generated by Cursor Agent | Date: February 6, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

RISKCAST is a visually ambitious, architecturally incomplete prototype. The design system is genuinely premium — the dark mode terminal aesthetic, the animation choreography, and the 7-Questions decision framework demonstrate product thinking that exceeds most seed-stage startups. However, the product is a **non-functional facade**: zero real API calls, zero authentication, zero data persistence, zero tests, and ~1,500 lines of dead code that were built but never wired in. Every user action resolves to a toast notification and a `setTimeout`. An enterprise buyer would be impressed for 90 seconds, then deeply concerned. An investor would see strong design taste but question engineering rigor and shipping discipline.

## SECTION SCORES

| # | Dimension | Score | One-Line Verdict |
|---|-----------|-------|------------------|
| D1 | First Impression & Trust | 7.0/10 | Genuinely premium visual language, undermined by hardcoded "Admin User" and demo artifacts |
| D2 | Information Architecture | 5.5/10 | Logical route hierarchy but flat, overloaded sidebar with no role-based views |
| D3 | Data Density & Readability | 7.0/10 | Strong typography and number formatting; tabular nums applied correctly; charts are readable |
| D4 | Decision Clarity | 6.5/10 | 7Q framework is a genuine UX innovation; undermined by length and lack of executive summary |
| D5 | Visual System Consistency | 5.5/10 | Tokens are comprehensive but 5x StatCard reimplementation + per-page FilterDropdown reveals discipline gaps |
| D6 | Interaction & Feedback | 2.5/10 | Every action is fake. Toast-only handlers everywhere. No confirmation dialogs. Keyboard hints are lies. |
| D7 | Enterprise Readiness | 1.5/10 | Zero auth, zero real API calls, zero tests, zero pagination, 1,500 lines dead code |
| D8 | Design System Scalability | 6.0/10 | Clean TypeScript, good file structure, but no Storybook, no Prettier, local component duplication |

## OVERALL SCORE: 5.2 / 10

The score reflects a product that is ~70% design execution and ~5% functional execution. The visual layer is genuinely competitive with funded Series A products (6.5-7 range). The functional layer is pre-prototype (1-2 range). The average masks a critical bimodal distribution: this product looks like it works but does not work. That gap is the primary risk.

---

## READINESS LEVEL

- [ ] Concept Demo
- [x] **Prototype**
- [ ] Early Production
- [ ] Production-Ready
- [ ] Enterprise-Ready
- [ ] Investor-Grade
- [ ] World-Class

This is a high-fidelity interactive prototype. It demonstrates the product vision, the information architecture, and the visual design language. It does not demonstrate any functional capability. No data is real, no action has side effects, no state persists across sessions. The term "prototype" is precise — it proves the concept without implementing it.

---

## D1: FIRST IMPRESSION & TRUST — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 7.0/10

The visual system is the product's strongest asset. `index.css` (960 lines) establishes a comprehensive dual-theme design system with semantic color tokens for urgency, severity, confidence, and action types. The dark mode is not a generic CSS toggle — it's a deliberate "Bloomberg Terminal meets Palantir Gotham" identity with cyan neon accents (`#00F5FF`), terminal glow effects, scan lines, and grid patterns.

### Strengths

- **Token comprehensiveness** (`index.css:8-193`): 80+ CSS custom properties covering colors, spacing, radii, shadows, blur, animations, and timing functions. This is genuinely enterprise-grade tokenization.
- **Dark mode identity** (`index.css:200-314`): The dark terminal aesthetic is a real differentiator. Neon cyan accent, glow shadows, terminal corner brackets, scan lines — this is not a default dark theme.
- **Sidebar animation quality** (`Sidebar.tsx:56-95`): The expand/collapse with spring physics, shared `layoutId="activeIndicator"` for active route animation (`Sidebar.tsx:289-297`), and collapsed-state tooltips show polish.
- **Typography discipline** (`index.css:89-91`): Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for data. `font-feature-settings: 'tnum' 1` is correctly applied via `.font-tabular` and `.data-value` classes.
- **Dashboard data density** (`dashboard/page.tsx:163-220`): The 4-stat grid with animated numbers, trend indicators, and gradient accents reads well.

### Weaknesses

- **Hardcoded "Admin User"** (`TopBar.tsx:225-231`): The user avatar shows "A" with "Admin" text. This immediately signals "demo" to any evaluator. `TopBar.tsx:379`: "Admin User" and "admin@riskcast.io" are hardcoded strings.
- **Hardcoded notification count** (`TopBar.tsx:202-204`): The number "3" is a literal, not from any data source. Same for sidebar badges (`Sidebar.tsx:43-45`): badge counts `3` and `2` are hardcoded.
- **"Premium Edition" text** (`Sidebar.tsx:242`): "v1.0.0 - Premium Edition" in the footer is aspirational branding in a prototype.
- **Sign out does nothing** (`TopBar.tsx:358-361`): `handleSignOut` fires `toast.info('Signing out... (Demo mode - no actual sign out)')` — explicitly tells the user it's fake.
- **Light mode is weaker** than dark mode. The dark mode has terminal effects, glow, scan lines. Light mode is a clean but generic professional dashboard — less differentiated.
- **Vite boilerplate remnants**: `public/vite.svg` and `src/assets/react.svg` are still in the repo, never referenced.

### Trust Impact Assessment

First 30 seconds: **Strong**. The dark terminal UI, animated numbers, and gradient accents create authority. First 3 minutes: **Eroding**. The hardcoded user, static notifications, and "Demo mode" toasts reveal the facade. For a demo to an investor or enterprise buyer, the first impression buys enough time — but the clock is ticking.

---

## D2: INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 5.5/10

The route hierarchy is logically sound for the domain. The flow from Dashboard (overview) → Signals (inputs) → Decisions (outputs) → Human Review (exceptions) maps to the RISKCAST conceptual pipeline. However, the sidebar is overloaded and the navigation lacks hierarchy.

### Strengths

- **Pipeline-aligned navigation** (`Sidebar.tsx:40-53`): Main nav (Dashboard, Signals, Decisions, Customers, Human Review) maps to the operational workflow. Secondary nav (Analytics, Audit, Reality, Settings) maps to administrative functions.
- **Lazy loading** (`router.tsx:7-19`): All pages are code-split with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`. Correct performance pattern.
- **Command palette** (`command-palette.tsx`): Cmd+K with fuzzy search, keyboard navigation, and grouped results. Functional and useful for power users.
- **Breadcrumb navigation** (`DecisionHeader.tsx`): Decision detail page has breadcrumb navigation (Decisions → ID). Not all detail pages have this.
- **404 catch-all** (`router.tsx:123-136`): Exists, though it's inline JSX rather than a proper page.

### Weaknesses

- **9 sidebar items** (`Sidebar.tsx:40-53`): For a focused risk tool, 9 items is too many. Customers, Analytics, Audit, and Reality could be subordinate views or tabs within existing pages.
- **No role-based views**: Zero auth guards in `router.tsx`. No distinction between analyst, manager, or executive views. A VP of Supply Chain and a junior analyst see identical interfaces.
- **No nested layouts**: Every page shares the same flat `AppLayout`. The Decision Detail page (the core product) gets the same chrome as Settings. The 7Q view should arguably have a dedicated, distraction-minimized layout.
- **Flat route hierarchy**: `router.tsx:44-121` shows all routes as direct children of AppLayout. No grouping, no nested route segments, no layout nesting.
- **Dead-end pages**: Analytics, Audit, and Reality pages are view-only with no clear next action. A user lands there and has no prompted workflow.
- **Missing Customers/Analytics/Reality in MobileNav** (`MobileNav.tsx:23-29`): Only 5 of 9 nav items appear on mobile. Users can't access Analytics, Audit, Reality, or Customers from the bottom nav.

---

## D3: DATA DENSITY & READABILITY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 7.0/10

Data formatting is a genuine strength. The formatter library and animated number system are well-executed.

### Strengths

- **Tabular numbers** (`index.css:509-512`): `.font-tabular` and `.data-value` correctly set `font-feature-settings: 'tnum' 1`. Applied in `dashboard/page.tsx:303` and `576` on monetary/numeric displays.
- **Formatter library** (`formatters.ts`, 302 lines): Comprehensive locale-aware formatting for currency (`formatCurrency`), percentages, numbers, durations, delay ranges, relative time, countdowns, TEU, and shipments. Supports EN and VI locales.
- **AnimatedNumber system** (`animated-number.tsx`, 416 lines): Spring-based number animation for currency, percentages, and counts. The animation aids perception of data freshness.
- **Dashboard stat cards** (`dashboard/page.tsx:170-220`): 4 KPIs with animated values, trend indicators, change deltas, and gradient accents. Readable within 3 seconds.
- **Chokepoint health** (`dashboard/page.tsx:363-416`): Compact data density — name, status dot, vessel count, delay — in a scannable list.
- **Mono font for data** (`dashboard/page.tsx:303,401`): JetBrains Mono consistently used for numeric values and timestamps.
- **Confidence interval display** (`CostDisplay.tsx`): Visual CI bar with point estimate marker, lower/upper bounds — Bloomberg-quality data presentation.

### Weaknesses

- **Charts lack alt text** (`ExposureChart.tsx`, `CostEscalationChart.tsx`, all chart components): Zero ARIA descriptions on any SVG chart. Screen readers get nothing.
- **Hardcoded hex colors in TSX** (`DecisionCard.tsx`: 6 instances, `ExposureChart.tsx`: 2 instances): Some colors bypass the token system. Found via grep: `#FF6B35`, `#EA580C` in ExposureChart.
- **Analytics page density** (`analytics/page.tsx`, 1040 lines): Potentially overwhelming — 4 KPIs + 4 charts + system health grid on one page. No progressive disclosure.
- **No data table component**: Audit page and other list views use custom card layouts. No proper data table with sortable columns for dense data views.

---

## D4: DECISION CLARITY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 6.5/10

The 7-Questions framework is RISKCAST's most innovative UX contribution. It transforms a traditional risk report into a guided decision flow. However, the implementation doesn't fully realize the concept.

### Strengths

- **7Q as a decision framework** (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx:46-124`): The structured Q1→Q7 flow with visual question wrappers, staggered animation, and highlighted Q5 (the recommendation) is a genuine UX innovation. No competitor structures decisions this way.
- **Q5 visual dominance** (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx:88-91`): Q5 gets `isHighlighted` prop, which adds a glow background (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx:162-174`) and elevated z-index. The recommended action is visually differentiated.
- **Cost of inaction** (`Q7IfNothing.tsx`, 472 lines): The PONR countdown, cost escalation timeline, and "worst case scenario" box create genuine urgency. This is the most compelling question.
- **Sticky action bar** (`ActionButtons.tsx:38-46`): Accept/Override/Escalate fixed at the bottom with glassmorphic background. The user never loses sight of the CTA.
- **Alternatives comparison** (`Q5WhatToDo.tsx`): Card view and table view toggle for comparing recommended vs alternative actions. Cost differentials and risk ratings included.
- **Accordion variant exists** (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx:198-299`): `SevenQuestionsAccordion` provides a mobile-optimized collapsible view with Q5 pre-expanded. Smart progressive disclosure.

### Weaknesses

- **No executive summary / TL;DR**: The 7Q view starts with `DecisionHeader` (badges, ID, timestamp) then immediately drops into Q1. There is no 3-line executive summary that answers: "What happened, how bad, what to do." A VP under time pressure must scroll through all 7 sections to understand the situation.
- **All 7 questions at equal visual weight** (`SevenQuestionsView.tsx:64-102`): Despite Q5 being highlighted, Q1-Q4 and Q6-Q7 all have the same card size and spacing. There is no visual hierarchy saying "Q1 and Q5 are the ones you must read; Q2-Q4 and Q6-Q7 are supporting detail."
- **Q5 is 679 lines** (`Q5WhatToDo.tsx`): The most important question is also the longest component. The action details, alternatives comparison, comparison table, and assumptions section create cognitive overload. The recommended action gets lost in the detail.
- **Accordion variant is never used**: `SevenQuestionsAccordion` is exported (`decisions/index.ts`) but the actual `decisions/[id]/page.tsx:42-50` always renders `SevenQuestionsView` (the full scroll layout), even on mobile.
- **Confidence score lacks calibration context** (`Q6Confidence.tsx`): The gauge shows "82%" but there's no reference frame. Is 82% high for this type of decision? What was the accuracy of past 82% predictions? The score is presented without calibration data.
- **Decision detail page is thin** (`decisions/[id]/page.tsx`, 56 lines): All it does is look up mock data by ID, pass it to `SevenQuestionsView`, and wire toast handlers. No loading state management, no error handling for missing decisions, no URL-based state.

---

## D5: VISUAL SYSTEM CONSISTENCY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 5.5/10

The token system in `index.css` is genuinely comprehensive. The breakdown is in component-level discipline — tokens exist but components are reimplemented rather than shared.

### Strengths

- **Comprehensive tokens** (`index.css:8-193`): Colors, spacing, radii, shadows, blur, animations, timing — all tokenized in Tailwind v4's `@theme` directive.
- **CVA variant system** (`button.tsx`, `badge.tsx`, `card.tsx`): class-variance-authority used for systematic variant management. Badge has 25+ variants covering urgency, severity, confidence, action types.
- **Consistent urgency colors**: `IMMEDIATE=#DC2626`, `URGENT=#F97316`, `SOON=#EAB308`, `WATCH=#6B7280` used identically in `UrgencyBadge`, `DecisionCard`, `dashboard/page.tsx`, `Sidebar` badges.
- **Dark mode is systematic**: Not a patchwork of overrides. `index.css:200-314` defines a complete parallel token set that's internally consistent.
- **Barrel exports** (`index.ts` files): Present in all component directories (layout, decisions, signals, common, charts, ui). Consistent pattern.

### Weaknesses

- **StatCard reimplemented 5 times**: `dashboard/page.tsx:500-598`, `customers/page.tsx` (inline), `human-review/page.tsx` (inline), `audit/page.tsx` (inline), `reality/page.tsx` (inline). Each has slightly different props and styling. Should be one shared component.
- **FilterDropdown reimplemented per page**: `decisions/page.tsx` and `signals/page.tsx` both define local `FilterDropdown` components with keyboard navigation. Identical pattern, no shared code.
- **MetricCard reimplemented**: `signals/[id]/page.tsx` defines a local `MetricCard`. Dashboard has its own `StatCard`. Could share one component.
- **EscalationCard in human-review/page.tsx**: Local component that duplicates patterns from `DecisionCard`.
- **TerminalCard in analytics/page.tsx**: Local wrapper around `Card` that could be a shared variant.
- **8 hardcoded hex colors in TSX files** (`DecisionCard.tsx`: 6, `ExposureChart.tsx`: 2): Bypassing the design token system.
- **UI barrel export is incomplete** (`components/ui/index.ts`): Only exports Button, Card, and Badge. Toast, Skeleton, AnimatedNumber, CommandPalette, ErrorBoundary, and others require direct file imports.

---

## D6: INTERACTION & FEEDBACK — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 2.5/10

This is the weakest dimension and the most critical trust problem. Every user action in the application is theatrical — it displays feedback but has no real effect.

### Strengths

- **Toast system is well-built** (`toast.tsx`, 401 lines): Zustand-backed, 5 types, auto-dismiss with progress, action buttons, promise helper. The infrastructure is solid.
- **Button loading states** (`button.tsx`): `isLoading` prop with spinner, disabled state, loading text. Properly implemented.
- **Hover/tap feedback** (`button.tsx`, `card.tsx`): Framer Motion `whileHover`, `whileTap` with spring physics on all interactive elements.

### Weaknesses

#### Fake Action Registry (COMPLETE)

Every entry below fires a toast and/or setTimeout with zero real side effects:

| Action | File:Line | What Actually Happens | Trust Impact |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Accept Decision | `decisions/[id]/page.tsx:18-23` | `setTimeout(1500)` → toast → navigate | **CRITICAL** — Core product action is fake |
| Override Decision | `decisions/[id]/page.tsx:26-29` | `toast.info('Override modal...')` — no modal exists | **CRITICAL** — Promises modal that doesn't exist |
| Escalate Decision | `decisions/[id]/page.tsx:31-33` | `toast.warning()` → navigate to `/human-review` | **HIGH** — No escalation created |
| Request More Info | `decisions/[id]/page.tsx:36-38` | `toast.info()` | **HIGH** |
| Acknowledge (list) | `decisions/page.tsx:119-123` | `setTimeout(1000)` → `console.log` → toast | **HIGH** |
| Refresh Decisions | `decisions/page.tsx:91-96` | `setTimeout(1000)` → toast | **MEDIUM** |
| Refresh Signals | `signals/page.tsx:39-43` | `setTimeout(1000)` → toast | **MEDIUM** |
| Refresh Signal | `signals/[id]/page.tsx:57-62` | `setTimeout(1000)` → toast | **MEDIUM** |
| Dismiss Signal | `signals/[id]/page.tsx:64-67` | `toast.warning()` → `setTimeout(1500)` → navigate | **HIGH** |
| Generate Decision | `signals/[id]/page.tsx:69-72` | `toast.info()` → `setTimeout(1500)` → navigate to hardcoded `/decisions/dec_001` | **HIGH** |
| Add Customer | `customers/page.tsx:61-63` | `toast.info('(Demo mode)')` | **MEDIUM** |
| Edit Customer | `customers/[id]/page.tsx:143-145` | `toast.info('(Demo mode)')` | **MEDIUM** |
| Approve Escalation | `human-review/[id]/page.tsx:201-205` | `toast.success()` → `setTimeout(1500)` → navigate | **CRITICAL** |
| Reject Escalation | `human-review/[id]/page.tsx:207-209` | `toast.warning()` | **HIGH** |
| Assign to Me | `human-review/[id]/page.tsx:211-213` | `toast.success()` | **HIGH** |
| Add Comment | `human-review/[id]/page.tsx:195-198` | `toast.success()` → clears input | **MEDIUM** |
| Save Settings | `settings/page.tsx:18-25` | `setTimeout(1000)` → `setTimeout(2000)` for button state reset | **MEDIUM** |
| Export Report | `analytics/page.tsx:97-98` | `toast.success('(Demo mode)')` | **LOW** |
| Export Audit | `audit/page.tsx:69` | `toast.success('(Demo mode)')` | **LOW** |
| Refresh Reality | `reality/page.tsx:55` | `setTimeout(1500)` | **MEDIUM** |
| Refresh Escalations | `human-review/page.tsx:119-123` | `setTimeout(1000)` → toast | **MEDIUM** |
| Sign Out | `TopBar.tsx:358-361` | `toast.info('Demo mode - no actual sign out')` | **HIGH** |
| System Status | `dashboard/page.tsx:105-107` | `toast.success('All systems operational')` | **LOW** |
| Change Date Range | `analytics/page.tsx:91-95` | Updates local state only — chart data doesn't change | **MEDIUM** |

**Total fake actions: 24.** Zero real side effects anywhere in the application.

#### Other Interaction Issues

- **Keyboard hints are decorative lies** (`ActionButtons.tsx:149-169`): `Enter`, `O`, `E` keyboard shortcuts are displayed but zero `keydown` event listeners exist in the component. Users who try them get nothing.
- **No confirmation dialogs**: Accept Decision and Approve Escalation are high-stakes actions that execute immediately on click. No "Are you sure?" dialog. No undo mechanism.
- **Override has no justification input** (`decisions/[id]/page.tsx:26-29`): The handler fires a toast saying "Override modal - select alternative action" but no modal exists. The comment says `// In production: open modal for user to select alternative`.
- **`console.log` in production code** (`decisions/page.tsx:122`, `theme-provider.tsx:65`): Debug logging left in.

---

## D7: ENTERPRISE READINESS — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 1.5/10

This score reflects a hard reality: the product has zero functional infrastructure for enterprise deployment.

### Critical Failures

- **Zero authentication** (`router.tsx`): No auth guards, no login page, no token management, no session handling. Every route is publicly accessible. **Automatic cap at 4/10.**
- **Zero real API integration**: `lib/api.ts` (221 lines) is a fully implemented API client that is **never called by any page**. All 13 pages use hardcoded mock data. `hooks/useDecisions.ts` (121 lines) defines React Query hooks that are **never imported**. **Automatic cap at 3/10.**
- **Zero tests**: No test files exist anywhere in the codebase. No `*.test.ts`, no `*.spec.ts`, no test directory, no test configuration.
- **Zero pagination**: All lists render all items. With real data (500+ decisions), the UI would be unusable.
- **1,531 lines of dead code**: Fully implemented modules that are never imported (see Dead Code Inventory).
- **Unused npm dependencies**: `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod` installed but never imported. `@tanstack/react-query` configured but hooks never used by pages.
- **No error handling for missing data**: `decisions/[id]/page.tsx:14-16` — if `id` doesn't match, falls back to `mockDecision` instead of showing a 404 or error state. Same pattern in `customers/[id]`, `signals/[id]`, `human-review/[id]`.
- **No data persistence**: Settings changes, filter states, and user preferences (except theme) are lost on page reload.
- **404 page is inline JSX** (`router.tsx:125-135`): 10 lines of inline JSX instead of a proper error page component.
- **Audit trail is decorative** (`AuditTrailFooter.tsx`): Hash verification is simulated with `setTimeout` and a 90% random success rate. The SHA256 hashes are hardcoded strings.
- **`console.log` statements in production**: 4 files contain debug logging (`decisions/page.tsx:122`, `BatchOperations.tsx:125,135,145`, `error-boundary.tsx:50`, `theme-provider.tsx:65`).
- **No HTTPS enforcement, no CSP, no security headers**.
- **No environment variable validation**: `VITE_API_URL` falls back to `'http://localhost:8000/api/v1'` silently.

### Accessibility (WCAG AA) Assessment

| Issue | Severity | Components | WCAG Criterion |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Charts have zero ARIA descriptions | High | All 6 chart components | 1.1.1 Non-text Content |
| Q1-Q5, Q7 lack semantic structure | Medium | 6 decision components | 1.3.1 Info and Relationships |
| DecisionCard, SignalCard lack ARIA roles | Medium | 2 card components | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value |
| Filter dropdowns lack `role="listbox"` | Medium | 2 page-local components | 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value |
| Keyboard hints non-functional | Medium | ActionButtons.tsx | 2.1.1 Keyboard |
| Color-only status in compact views | Medium | UrgencyBadge, SeverityBadge (sm size) | 1.4.1 Use of Color |
| Toast lacks `role="alert"` or `aria-live` | Medium | toast.tsx | 4.1.3 Status Messages |
| No focus trap in TopBar dropdowns | Low | TopBar.tsx | 2.4.3 Focus Order |
| **Best a11y:** CountdownTimer (`role="timer"`, `aria-live`), MobileNav (WCAG touch targets), ReasoningTraceModal (`role="dialog"`) | — | — | — |

### What Actually Works

1. Theme toggle (light/dark/system) — persists to localStorage
2. Client-side routing — all navigation works
3. Client-side filtering/sorting — works on mock data
4. Command palette — functional with keyboard nav
5. Responsive layout — mobile sidebar/bottom nav works

---

## D8: DESIGN SYSTEM SCALABILITY — DETAILED FINDINGS

### Score: 6.0/10

The TypeScript foundation is clean, but the system lacks the tooling and discipline needed for team scaling.

### Strengths

- **Zero `any` types, zero `@ts-ignore`, zero `@ts-expect-error`**: Grep confirms clean TypeScript across the entire codebase.
- **Comprehensive type system** (`types/decision.ts`, 258 lines): Full 7Q framework typed with all sub-types, enums, and API request/response types. Mirrors the backend schema.
- **Component file structure**: `domain/` vs `ui/` vs `charts/` separation is clear and logical.
- **Animation system reuse** (`animations.ts`, 689 lines): Shared variants used by components rather than ad-hoc inline animations.
- **Chart theme system** (`chart-theme.ts`, 489 lines): `useChartColors` hook reactively provides theme-appropriate colors.
- **i18n infrastructure** (`lib/i18n/`, 439 lines total): Full EN + VI translation system with context provider.

### Weaknesses

- **No component documentation** (Storybook, etc.): A new developer has no way to browse available components, their variants, or their props.
- **No Prettier configuration**: No `.prettierrc`, no format-on-save. Code style depends on individual editor settings.
- **Local component reimplementations**: StatCard (5x), FilterDropdown (2x), MetricCard, EscalationCard, TerminalCard. A new developer would likely create yet another variant.
- **Dead code signals maintenance neglect**: 1,531 lines of code were built, committed, and abandoned. `stores/app.ts` (4 Zustand stores), `hooks/useDecisions.ts` (React Query hooks), `BatchOperations.tsx`, `progress-ring.tsx`, `language-switcher.tsx` — none were deleted or integrated.
- **Barrel export inconsistency**: `components/ui/index.ts` only exports Button, Card, Badge. The other 10 UI components require direct file imports. Chart and domain barrel exports are comprehensive.
- **Some useMemo/useCallback usage** (28 instances across components) but no `React.memo` on any component. For a data-dense application, this will cause performance issues at scale.
- **No error monitoring integration**: The single TODO in the codebase (`error-boundary.tsx:55`) is `// TODO: Send to error reporting service (e.g., Sentry)`.

## COMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING

### vs Bloomberg Terminal

| Dimension | RISKCAST | Bloomberg |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Data density** | Medium. 4 KPIs + 3 urgent items + 4 chokepoints on dashboard. Generous whitespace. | Extreme. 50+ data points visible simultaneously. Zero wasted space. |
| **Keyboard-first** | Command palette (Cmd+K) is the only keyboard feature. Keyboard hints on action buttons are non-functional. | Everything keyboard-driven. Every action has a shortcut. Terminal input is primary interaction. |
| **Information hierarchy** | Clear but shallow. 7Q framework provides structure. | Deep. Multiple nested panels, windows, monitors. |
| **Trust signals** | Strong visual design, but "Admin User" and fake data undermine it. | Decades of real-time market data. Trust is earned, not designed. |

**Where competitive:** Visual polish of the 7Q decision view. Bloomberg has no equivalent guided decision flow.
**Where clearly behind:** Data density, keyboard interaction, real-time data, multi-panel workflows.

### vs Palantir Foundry

| Dimension | RISKCAST | Palantir |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Analytical depth** | Single-dimension: 7 questions per decision. No cross-referencing, no ontology. | Multi-dimensional. Ontology-based. Graph relationships between entities. |
| **Workflow complexity** | Linear: Signal → Decision → Action. No branching, no parallel workflows. | Arbitrary complexity. Custom pipelines, approval chains, conditional logic. |
| **Visual gravitas** | Dark terminal aesthetic is effective. Glow effects, scan lines. | More restrained. Darker, denser, less decorative. |
| **AI integration UX** | ReasoningTraceModal shows AI steps — good transparency. All data is mock. | Real AI models with actual outputs. Explanation is secondary to results. |

**Where competitive:** The 7Q framework as a decision presentation paradigm. The ReasoningTraceModal concept.
**Where clearly behind:** No real data, no ontology, no entity relationships, no workflow engine.

### vs Stripe Dashboard

| Dimension | RISKCAST | Stripe |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Design system** | Strong tokens in CSS. CVA variants. But 5x StatCard duplication. | World-class. Every component shared. Zero duplication. Storybook documented. |
| **Component consistency** | Good within ui/ primitives. Breaks down in page-level components. | Perfect. Every page uses shared components. |
| **Error handling** | Zero. All actions are toast-only. | Every API call has loading, error, and empty states. Retry mechanisms. |
| **Developer experience** | Clean TypeScript, no `any`. No Storybook, no Prettier. | TypeScript strict. Storybook. Automated tests. CI/CD. |

**Where competitive:** Visual ambition exceeds Stripe's utilitarian approach. The dark terminal aesthetic is more distinctive.
**Where clearly behind:** Component discipline, error handling, testing, developer tooling.

### vs Notion

| Dimension | RISKCAST | Notion |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Information structure** | Fixed 7Q structure. Clear but rigid. | Flexible blocks. User-defined structure. |
| **Navigation simplicity** | 9 sidebar items. Flat hierarchy. | Minimal sidebar. Tree navigation. Infinite nesting. |
| **Empty state handling** | Present on all list pages. Missing on detail pages. | Every page has thoughtful empty states with clear CTAs. |
| **Progressive disclosure** | 7Q sequence is good. Accordion variant exists but unused. Q4 has `<details>`. | Master of progressive disclosure. Everything collapses, expands, and nests. |

**Where competitive:** Domain-specific data visualization (chokepoints, exposure, confidence gauges).
**Where clearly behind:** Navigation simplicity, progressive disclosure depth, empty states.

### vs Flexport / Everstream / project44

| Dimension | RISKCAST | Logistics Platforms |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Domain relevance** | Strong. Chokepoints, vessels, TEU, routes, PO numbers. Correct terminology. | Native. Real carrier integrations, real tracking data, real rate feeds. |
| **Data presentation** | Dollar amounts, not percentages. Delay in days. Specific shipment IDs. Correct approach. | Real data from real shipments. Carrier-level granularity. |
| **Terminology** | Correct: "chokepoint", "TEU", "exposure", "reroute via Cape". Domain-authentic. | Industry-standard. ETA, BOL, container tracking, customs documentation. |
| **Workflow support** | Signal → Decision → Action. Single linear path. | Multi-step workflows: booking, tracking, customs, insurance, claims. |

**Where competitive:** The 7Q decision framework is unique. No logistics platform structures risk decisions this way. The confidence interval presentation on cost estimates is more transparent than competitors.
**Where clearly behind:** Zero real data integration. No carrier APIs, no AIS tracking, no rate feeds. The mock data simulates what these platforms have for real.

## TOP 5 CRITICAL WEAKNESSES

### 1. Zero Functional Backend Integration

- **What:** Every user action resolves to `toast()` + `setTimeout()`. The API client exists but is never called. React Query hooks exist but are never imported. Zero data persists.
- **Where:** All 13 page files; `lib/api.ts` (never called); `hooks/useDecisions.ts` (never imported)
- **Trust Impact:** A user who clicks "Accept Recommendation" and sees a toast but no actual change will immediately distrust the system. For a risk decision platform, false feedback is the worst possible UX failure.
- **Decision Risk:** If shipped in this state, a user might believe they've acknowledged a decision when they haven't. In a real supply chain disruption, this causes operational failures.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk:** No enterprise procurement team will evaluate a product with zero functional backend. This fails at the first technical due diligence checkpoint.
- **Investor Perception:** "The team can design but can't ship. Beautiful mockup, zero engineering depth. Where's the backend?"

### 2. Zero Authentication/Authorization

- **What:** No login page, no auth guards, no session management, no role-based access. Every route is publicly accessible.
- **Where:** `router.tsx` (zero guards); `TopBar.tsx:225-231` (hardcoded "Admin User"); `stores/app.ts:useUserStore` (defined but never used)
- **Trust Impact:** Any enterprise evaluator will immediately ask "How do users log in?" and the answer is "They don't."
- **Decision Risk:** Without role-based views, a junior analyst has the same power as a VP. No approval workflows possible.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk:** Absolute dealbreaker. No CISO will approve deployment of a system with no authentication.
- **Investor Perception:** "This is a demo. It's not a product. Concerning that auth wasn't prioritized given they built 21,000 lines of UI."

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts Are Non-Functional Lies

- **What:** `ActionButtons.tsx:149-169` displays keyboard shortcuts `Enter` (Accept), `O` (Override), `E` (Escalate) that have zero key event listeners.
- **Where:** `ActionButtons.tsx:149-169`
- **Trust Impact:** A power user who reads the hints and presses `Enter` to accept a recommendation gets nothing. This is a direct credibility violation. The UI explicitly claims functionality that doesn't exist.
- **Decision Risk:** During a time-critical incident, keyboard shortcuts save seconds. Broken shortcuts cost time.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk:** Enterprise users expect keyboard-first interfaces for high-frequency workflows. Decorative shortcuts signal that the product hasn't been user-tested.
- **Investor Perception:** "They added UI chrome for keyboard shortcuts without implementing them. This suggests feature checkboxing over functional depth."

### 4. Component Duplication (5x StatCard, 2x FilterDropdown)

- **What:** `StatCard` is reimplemented locally in 5 different page files with slightly different props. `FilterDropdown` is duplicated in 2 pages with identical keyboard navigation logic.
- **Where:** StatCard: `dashboard/page.tsx:500-598`, `customers/page.tsx`, `human-review/page.tsx`, `audit/page.tsx`, `reality/page.tsx`. FilterDropdown: `decisions/page.tsx`, `signals/page.tsx`.
- **Trust Impact:** Low direct user impact, but signals architectural decay.
- **Decision Risk:** None directly.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk:** A code audit would flag this as maintenance risk. Each StatCard variant could diverge in behavior.
- **Investor Perception:** "Solo developer moving fast, but technical debt is accumulating early. Will this codebase support a team of 5?"

### 5. 1,531 Lines of Dead Code

- **What:** Fully implemented modules that are never imported: `App.tsx` (270), `stores/app.ts` (250), `useDecisions.ts` (121), `language-switcher.tsx` (94), `progress-ring.tsx` (410), `BatchOperations.tsx` (386).
- **Where:** Listed above with line counts.
- **Trust Impact:** No direct user impact.
- **Decision Risk:** None.
- **Enterprise Adoption Risk:** Signals poor code hygiene. In an enterprise codebase, dead code creates confusion and maintenance burden.
- **Investor Perception:** "The developer built things and abandoned them. Is this a pattern? Were these features started and not finished, or replaced by something better? Either way, they should have been deleted."

## TOP 5 HIGHEST-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Wire Up API Client + React Query Hooks to All Pages

- **What to do:** Replace all hardcoded mock data in pages with `useDecisions`, `useSignals`, etc. hooks. Wire `lib/api.ts` to the actual backend. Add loading/error/empty states to every page.
- **Why it matters:** Transforms the product from a prototype to a functional application. Every other improvement depends on this.
- **Effort estimate:** L (Large) — every page needs refactoring
- **Files affected:** All 13 page files, `hooks/useDecisions.ts`, `lib/api.ts`
- **Expected score impact:** D6: +3.0, D7: +3.0, D4: +0.5

### 2. Add Authentication + Role-Based Views

- **What to do:** Implement login page, JWT/session management, route guards in `router.tsx`, and role-based navigation (Analyst vs Manager vs Executive views).
- **Why it matters:** Minimum viable enterprise requirement. Unlocks role-based decision workflows (analyst recommends, manager approves).
- **Effort estimate:** L
- **Files affected:** `router.tsx`, new `auth/` module, `TopBar.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `stores/app.ts`
- **Expected score impact:** D7: +3.0, D2: +1.5

### 3. Add Executive Summary to Decision Detail

- **What to do:** Add a 3-line summary card at the top of `SevenQuestionsView` that answers: "What? How bad? What to do?" — visible without scrolling. Consider: event title, total exposure in dollars, recommended action with cost.
- **Why it matters:** A VP under time pressure needs the bottom line in 5 seconds. Currently requires reading all 7 sections.
- **Effort estimate:** S (Small)
- **Files affected:** `SevenQuestionsView.tsx`, possibly new `ExecutiveSummary.tsx` component
- **Expected score impact:** D4: +1.5, D1: +0.5

### 4. Extract Shared Components (StatCard, FilterDropdown)

- **What to do:** Create `components/domain/common/StatCard.tsx` and `components/ui/filter-dropdown.tsx`. Replace all 5 StatCard implementations and 2 FilterDropdown implementations with shared versions.
- **Why it matters:** Reduces 7 local implementations to 2 shared components. Ensures visual consistency. Simplifies maintenance.
- **Effort estimate:** M (Medium)
- **Files affected:** 7 page files, 2 new shared components
- **Expected score impact:** D5: +1.5, D8: +0.5

### 5. Implement Real Keyboard Shortcuts

- **What to do:** Add `useEffect` with `keydown` listeners in `ActionButtons.tsx` for Enter (Accept), O (Override), E (Escalate). Add keyboard shortcut handling to `SevenQuestionsView` level where the action handlers live.
- **Why it matters:** Fixes a trust violation. Transforms decorative hints into real functionality. Signals keyboard-first design intent.
- **Effort estimate:** S
- **Files affected:** `ActionButtons.tsx` or `SevenQuestionsView.tsx`
- **Expected score impact:** D6: +1.0, D1: +0.5

## DESIGN DEBT SUMMARY

The fundamental structural UX problem is the **gap between visual promise and functional reality**. RISKCAST has built a $50K design system on top of a $0 backend integration. Every pixel signals "enterprise-grade analytical tool" while every interaction signals "interactive mockup." This creates a trust inversion: the more polished the UI looks, the more jarring the discovery that nothing actually works.

The design debt is not in the visual layer — that's genuinely strong. The debt is in the **interaction layer**: no real state management, no real API calls, no real persistence, no real error handling. The system has 21,000 lines of code and zero lines that modify server-side state. Until the interaction layer matches the visual layer, every new feature added to the UI increases the trust debt rather than reducing it.

The architectural fix is not "add more features." It is: wire the existing features to real data, then earn the right to build more.

## INVESTOR IMPRESSION

**Paragraph 1 — First Impression (positive):**
"The dark terminal aesthetic is distinctive — this doesn't look like every other SaaS dashboard. The 7-Questions framework for structuring risk decisions is a genuine product insight; I haven't seen this in Flexport, Everstream, or project44. The data visualization quality — confidence gauges, cost escalation charts, causal chain diagrams — shows a founder who understands that logistics executives need data presented at Bloomberg-level density, not dumbed-down consumer dashboards. The design system work (960 lines of CSS tokens, comprehensive animation library, dual-theme support) signals taste and ambition. For a solo developer, the visual execution is legitimately impressive."

**Paragraph 2 — Due Diligence Concerns (critical):**
"But the demo raises serious questions. I clicked 'Accept Recommendation' on a critical Red Sea disruption decision and got a toast notification — then nothing happened. I checked the code: every single user action in the application resolves to `toast()` plus `setTimeout()`. There is a fully implemented API client that's never called. There are React Query hooks, Zustand stores, and even batch operations — all built but never wired in. That's 1,500 lines of dead code alongside 21,000 lines of UI that connects to nothing. The product has a 7/10 design and a 1.5/10 backend integration. I need to understand: is the backend built? If so, why isn't it connected? If not, what has the team been doing? Before writing a check, I need to see real data flowing through real API calls, at least one end-to-end workflow that persists state, and a plan for the 'Accept Decision' button to actually accept a decision."

## CORE PRODUCT TRUTH TEST

**1. If the AI engine was removed, would the UI still feel valuable?**
Yes, partially. The 7-Questions framework is a decision presentation paradigm that has value independent of AI. A manually curated risk report structured as Q1-Q7 would still be more useful than a traditional flat report. But the confidence gauge, causal chain, and cost escalation projections all require AI-generated data. Without AI, the UI is a premium template for manual risk reports.

**2. Is the 7-question system truly superior to a traditional risk report?**
In concept, yes. It structures information around decisions rather than events. Traditional risk reports describe what happened; the 7Q framework tells you what to do, by when, at what cost, and what happens if you don't. The presentation — urgency-coded, time-pressured, action-oriented — is designed for operators, not analysts. However, the implementation makes Q1-Q7 feel like 7 sequential walls of content rather than 7 quick answers. An executive summary at the top would transform it.

**3. Would a real logistics executive rely on this during a crisis?**
Not today. The mock data demonstrates the concept, but during a real Red Sea disruption, an executive needs: (a) real-time vessel positions, (b) actual rate quotes, (c) confirmed carrier availability, (d) decisions that execute when approved. RISKCAST shows none of these. The 7Q framework is the right presentation layer, but it needs real data underneath.

**4. Is this product solving a painful, frequent, expensive problem?**
Yes. Supply chain disruptions cost billions annually. The gap between "signal detected" and "action taken" is where money is lost. RISKCAST's thesis — turn signals into personalized, actionable decisions with specific dollar amounts and deadlines — addresses a real, expensive pain point. The market is valid. The execution is not yet there.

**5. What is the biggest illusion in this product?**
The biggest illusion is **functional completeness**. The UI is so polished that it creates the impression of a working product. Animated numbers count up. Countdown timers tick down. Confidence gauges animate. Charts render. Toasts pop up confirming actions. Everything *feels* alive. But nothing *is* alive. No data is real. No action persists. No decision is recorded. The system simulates activity without performing any. This is the most dangerous illusion because it can deceive the builder into believing the product is further along than it is.
